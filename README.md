### Statistical Analysis, Algorithm / Numeric Libraries, and Data Structures Using C++ with the aim of writing readable code and reducing sources of errors.
smalldata.txt is a file containing 2500 individuals, described by their first name, city, age, and 100-meter race time. In this code, I use a Fiche structure to describe a person. This code primarily relies on data structures (basic algorithms, search, sorting, etc.), tests, loops, and the rich standard library, which gives C++ an advantage over other languages, especially C. In this code, I use the equivalent algorithms by leveraging libraries such as 'algorithm', 'numeric', and notably the use of iterators, both in functions and the <iterator> library.

Additionally, there is the use of several containers: the std::vector<T> class, std::set<T>, and std::map<E,F>.
